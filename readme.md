# PathPlanning-AR

This project presents an AR application developed for iOS devices that 
provides users with an interactive and customizable environment in which 
they can simulate multiple path-planning algorithms including 
Breadth-First Search, Dijkstra’s Algorithm, and A*. The intention is to 
provide those that are new to the subject a supplement to traditional 
teaching methods that will enhance their understanding of the topic through 
more engaging 3D visualization.
