However, A* doesn't simply prioritize minimum path cost. It uses the combination of a heuristic value as well as the path cost to prioritize nodes to be searched. The heuristic can vary, but is often the calculated distance from a current node to the goal. Common heuristics for A* are Euclidean distance and Manhattan distance. The A* priority queue prioritizes F-cost where F = G + H. G is the pathCost and H is the heuristic value of a given node. Similar to Dijkstra's algorithm, the search terminates when the current node that pops off of the frontier is equal to the goal node. \n \n Pseudocode: \n \n Append start node to frontier with 0 pathCost \n While frontier NOT empty: \n    currentNode = Frontier.pop(0) \n    If currentNode = Goal \n        return Path \n    Add currentNode to ExploredList \n    For each neighbor of current node: \n        Update neighborNode F-cost \n        If neighbor NOT in ExploredList or Frontier \n            Frontier.append(neighborNode) \n        Else If neighbor IN Frontier \n            If neighborNode F-cost < Frontier F-cost \n                Replace Frontier node with neighborNode"
